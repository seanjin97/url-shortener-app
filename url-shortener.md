## The Task

Build a URL shortener, just like [https://bit.ly](https://bit.ly/)

## Basic Requirements

1. As a shortened URL creator, I want to shorten a normal URL to a shortened one, so that I can have a shorter URL to disseminate.
   - Sample request: `www.google.com `
   - Sample response: `sho.rt/sdf87sf`
2. As a shortened URL consumer, I want to click on a shortened URL and have it arrive at the full URL without further clicks, so that I can type less into my browser.

## Bonus Requirements

1. A simple frontend with an input box for entering the URL to be shortened
2. Deploy the web application to a publicly accessible hosting service
3. Persistence of the shortened URLs across system reboots (e.g. relational databases like MySQL)
4. Write 1 or 2 unit tests to demonstrate you understand how to write automated tests
